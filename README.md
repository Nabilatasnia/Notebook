It is a simple note taking application that is still under construction. Some important features of this application are:
- Language used: Kotlin
- MVVM architecture 
- REST API
- Hilt
- API integration with Retrofit
**UI(User Interface):**
- The main page of this application contains all the notes of the user
- Each note has a title and a description 
- The ADD button on the bottom right corner of the screen lets the user add note

  Challenges faced during development:
  The main challenge faced during this development was API intergration. A mock API server called, JSONHolder was used. This API does not have data about user credentials so it was not possible to
  implement user authentication.
